All the scenes are version controlled on my <a
href="https://github.com/jacksondk/povray">GitHub page</a>. You may do
whatever with it - but I would like to hear about it - in the unlikely
case that anyone do anything like that.

# Headers

In order to improve the look of a previous version of this site, I
switched to a theme which included the option to rotate between a
number of images in the header.

The <a
href="https://github.com/jacksondk/povray/blob/master/Headers/header1.pov">header1.pv</a>
is based on a very plain plane (pun intended), to form a uniform
background. I didn't want the header to be too busy. I added one of
the standard "insert objects" called "while loop circular singular
helix". I adjusted some of its parameters, changed the define into a
macro allowing me to modify the color of each of the composing balls
was we move around the circle. I chose to use the HSV color space as I
could easily create a nice rainbow effect with strong colors.

# Backgrounds

The directory <a
href="https://github.com/jacksondk/povray/tree/master/Backgrounds">Backgrounds</a>
contains some attempts to make some nice desktop backgrounds. The <a
href="https://github.com/jacksondk/povray/tree/master/Backgrounds/iso-surf.pov">iso-surf.pov</a>
one is fairly nice
