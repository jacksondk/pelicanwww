To solve problem #23 I apply simple brute force and we get to play a
little with F# sets. Find all abundant numbers below the given upper
limit. Create a set of all sums of these numbers (with a small
optimization where avoid computing both a+b and b+a). Then we make a
set difference and sums the remaining elements.

    let n = seq { 1 .. 28123 }
    let abundant number = (List.sumByInt (fun x->x) (Euler_utils.divisors number)) > 2*number
    let abundant_numbers = List.of_seq (Seq.filter abundant n ) 

    printfn "Number of abundant numbers: %d" (List.length abundant_numbers)

    let all_sums numbers = [ for i in numbers do
                                 for j in (Seq.filter (fun ji -> ji >= i ) numbers) do 
                                   yield i+j ] 
                               
    let all_numbers = Set.of_array [| 1..28123 |]                               
    let sums = Set.of_seq (all_sums abundant_numbers)
    let not_in_sum = Set.diff all_numbers sums

    printfn "Sum of remaining %d" (Set.fold (+) not_in_sum 0)

The Euler_utils.divisors function computes all divisors including 1
and the number itself. Thus I compare with the number doubled in order
to detect an abundant number.
