# Employment History

* Developer at TNM Consult ApS (2004 - present). Developing software
  for Windows (Desktop and Mobile/PDA), embedded systems, definitions
  and specification of communication standards. Leader of the
  developer team.

* Developer at DSC Communications/Tellabs/Alcatel - the company was
  sold twice in the period where I worked there (1997 - 2000). Windows
  programming and development of a simulation tool.

* Assistant teacher at the Technical University of Denmark in various
  courses (1996-2003):
 
* Numerical Analysis

* C++ programming

* Optimization

* Scientific Computing

* Network and computer support at Hempel Marine Paints (1995-1997)

# Language Skills

Danish is my native language. I communicate well in English both in
written and spoken form. I did learn German in high school but I
would merely survive in a German only speaking country.

# IT Skills

Currently I'm working with the following languages: 

* C# and the .NET Framework. I've developed applications with ASP.NET
  Web Services as back end for a Winforms application. I've also
  developed a .NET Compact Framework application that uses SQL CE when
  running offline. I have also created a couple of ASP.NET pages that
  display historic data and make "what if" simulations of pricing of
  pigs. Also experience with Windows Presentation Foundation and
  Windows Communication Foundation.

* C/C++ with standard UNIX libraries. I've made a series of CGI
  scripts to run and display the FarmWatch model. The application runs
  on a (relatively) small embeded system. I've also done some network
  programming where I create ESP packets in order to communicate with
  standard IPSec routers. I've also developed custom additions to a
  FreeBSD based router.

* Many small on/off projects, scripts and tools are made with Python.

* A couple of internal tools are made with the Ruby On Rails
  framework.

* Currently I'm trying to pick up F# a OCaml derived language for the
  .NET framework.

* During my studies I have worked extensively with Matlab.

* Certified SCRUM Master

* Basic Windows Active Directory Administration

* Basic Linux/Unix administration
