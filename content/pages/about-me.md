Updated: 2012-10-15

Welcome to my homepage where you will find examples and explanations
of what I am doing.

In addition to this web site, standard email and snail-mail you can
reach me through a number of other means. I have collected some of the
places that I use which also includes some kind of social dimension:

# Currently

Currently I work at <a
href="http://www.tnmgruppen.dk/tnmconsult/forside.htm">TNM Consult
ApS</a> which specializes in IT-solutions for the agricultural
sector. We do a wide range of things, such as programming for PDAs,
embedded systems and ordinary PC applications.

TNM Consult has a sister company <a
href="http://www.tnmgruppen.dk/tnmit/forside.htm">TNM it</a> which
does onside IT support including network installation for Danish
farmers.

# Academic Story 

I made my Ph.D. thesis <a
href="http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=3380">Modular
Regularization Algorithms</a> (<a
href="/Downloads/phd-thesis.pdf">pdf</a>) at <a
href="http://www.imm.dtu.dk/">Informatics and Mathematical
Modelling</a> at <a href="http://www.dtu.dk/">The Technical University
of Denmark</a>. The work was supervised by <a
href="http://www.imm.dtu.dk/%7Epch">Professor Per Christian
Hansen</a>.

Per Christain Hansen also supervised my my Masters Thesis <a
href="http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=3380">Two-Grid
Iterative Methods for Ill-Posed Problems</a> (<a
href="/Downloads/master-thesis.pdf">pdf</a>). The software, <a
href="http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/%7Etkj/MOOReTools/index.shtml">MOORe
Tools</a>, created during the study is also available. After I
finished my Ph.D, Toke Koldborg Jensen took over maintenance. However,
as he finished his Ph.D, maintenance is now in the hands of <a
href="http://www.imm.dtu.dk/%7Epch">Per Christian Hansen</a>. Toke
worked with us at TNM Consult for about a year. However, he is now
back at <a href="http://www.dtu.dk/">The Technical University of
Denmark</a>, albeit working with fish! It seems that working with
inverse problems leads to jobs within the area of food.
