The following is a list of the programs and tools that I install
when I get a new computer or reinstall it. I have divided the list
into two: The first list contains programs and utilities which can be
downloaded and at least tried out for free (some are shareware). The
second list contains the proprietary software that I use.

* [Total Commander](http://www.ghisler.com) - a Shareware file manager
in the spirit of Norton Commander.

* [Vim](http://www.vim.org) - an editor available on every platform. I
use it for small quick edits such as commit messages.

* [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is still
the editor that fits my the best. I've been an Emacs user for 16 years
and prefer it for working with larger amounts of text and code (other
than C# which I edit in Visual Studio.

* [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) - a minimalistic
browser with the right feature set for me. Firefox has some better
extensions but Chrome has in my opinion a better feel. I do keep the
other browsers around to test compatibility and logins of different
users.

* [Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) - SSH client.

* [Subversion (slik)](http://www.sliksvn.com/en/download) - I prefer
to do check ins, updates etc from the command line. The sliksvn build
of Subversion has served my well. The environment variable for the
EDITOR is set to vim.

* [Tortoise SVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/) - I use Tortoise SVN
when I need to inspect the log and the history of files.

* [Winmerge](http://www.winmerge.org) - is used together with Tortoise
SVN to inspect changes in my/our source code.

* [Skype](http://www.skype.com) - currently involved in a EU project
with participants from several countries in Europe. Skype makes it
easy to talk to one or more of them.

* [MagigDisk](http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-overview.htm) - to 
mount ISO images from MSDN. Save the environment - do not burn
ISOs to physical disks. However, Microsoft included this functionality
in Windows 8.

* [Keepass](http://keepass.info/) - generates and keeps all my
passwords. The password file is stored in my Dropbox and is therefore
available at all my devices.

* [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/) - synchronizes files
between my computers and makes them available to my iPad.

* [Evernote](http://evernote.com/) - I scan a lot of papers and
receipts and send them to Evernote. Evernote does OCR on the scans and
makes them searchable.

* [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) - freeware archive program.

* [Filezilla](http://filezilla-project.org/) - FTP/SFTP/SCP
program. Even though Total Commander also provides FTP support I
prefer Filezilla for transfers of a large number of files.  </ul>

The above list is free to download and try out. I also use a number of
programs (from Microsoft) that are not free. They are provided by my
employer:

* Microsoft Windows 7 - it actually works - and they copied my
multiple screen keyboard navigation setup and made it the
default!

* Microsoft Windows 8 - in most aspects an improved Windows
  7. However, the Metro/Modern part of the OS has not shown usefull to
  me as of now.


* Visual Studio 2005, 2008, 2010. I use 2005 and 2008 for programming .NET CF
1.0 programs and a program that used a charting library that I cannot
get to work with 2008.

* Word: Forced to use Word. Tex/LaTex is much more in line with my way
of producing documents. How it is possible to write anything but a
poster about a missing cat is a mystery. Word is a world of pain.

* OneNote: One of the best Microsoft programs I know of. The best
note taking experience with mouse and keyboard. If only OneNote was
available on the iPad (with handwriting recognition and such). The
OneNote thing currently available for the iPhone/iPad is not released in the
Danish iTunes store so I cannot say whether it is any good.

* Excel: Decent tool for budgets and the like.

* Outlook: Decent but a resource hog - how can it use 80 threads and
still freeze and seem to do nothing of importance to the user?
