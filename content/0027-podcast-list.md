When washing dishes, mowing the lawn or during commute I enjoy
listening to podcasts. The following is a list of my favorite
podcasts. I link to their homepage, but you can most likely also find
them via iTunes or whatever podcast software you happen to use.

First we take the podcasts in English:

* <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/">Hanselminutes</a> is a
  weekly show with main emphasis on Microsoft technologies, but also
  other geek related tips. The host Scott Hanselman is very good at
  asking his guests questions and make them explain things such that
  the listener can understand. Each episode is about 30 minutes, which
  I find to be a perfect length.

* <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/">Dot net rocks</a> is now at
  almost 700 shows. As the title implies it deals with Microsoft .NET
  technology. Each episode is around one hour long, which occasionally
  is to much. The shows are usually based around an interview with a
  developer of some kind.

* <a href="http://skeptoid.com/">Skeptoid</a> tries to take an
  scientific approach to conspiracy theories, urband legends etc. The
  features many cool subjects.

* <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/">WNYC's Radiolab</a> is an very
  well produced science show.

* <a href="http://sciencefriday.com/">Science Friday</a> produce two
  one-hour episodes each week where scientists are interviewed about
  their work.

* <a href="">Runas Radio</a> is a show similar to Dotnet rocks but
  dealing with IT issues such as storage, administration,
  virtualization etc. However, now and then it has a show that is
  interesting to a developer like me.

I also enjoy a couple of podcasts in my native language (Danish). They
are all produced by <a href="http://www.dr.dk">Danmarks Radio</a>, the
national public radio of Denmark which proves that we get something
for our money.

* <a href="http://www.dr.dk/harddisken">Harddisken</a> is a
  IT/technology show including news.

* <a href="http://www.dr.dk/P1/Videnskabensverden/">Videnskabens
  Verden</a> is a science show somewhat similar to Science
  Friday.

* <a href="http://www.dr.dk/p1/detektor">Detektor</a> is a
  fact-checking show. Statements from politicians, news-papers
  etc. are checked to see if they are valid or not. Every serious
  media should have a show like this to keep the level of invalid
  information low.

* <a
  href="http://www.dr.dk/Sporten/Fodboldmagasinet/">Fodboldmagasinet</a>
  a show about football (the European soccer kind). One hour of
  discussion about the previous weekends matches in Denmark, England,
  Germany, Spain and Italy.
