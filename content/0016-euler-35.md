Title: Project Euler #35

To create the rotations I make a "detour" by converting the number
into a string and then performing the rotations on the string.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4114163.js?file=euler32.fs"></script>

As you might notice, I have included the function
<code>filter_rotations</code> which takes only one of each "rotation
group". However, this is not part of the problem and this therefore
not used to compute the final answer.
