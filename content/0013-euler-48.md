Title: Project Euler #48

In order to keep the numbers in check we use the rule that

$$
  a \equiv v (\bmod m) \Rightarrow a b \equiv v b (\bmod m) 
$$

This rule is implemented in the powermod function. Note, that the
powermod function is not yet "tail recursive" and is therefore
vulnerable to stack overflow for (very) large b.

<pre>
#light

let rec powermod a b m =
    if b = 0I then
      1I
    else
      (a*(powermod a (b-1I) m)) % m

let sum = 
   let numbers = [1I .. 1000I]
   let res = Seq.zip numbers numbers 
             |> Seq.map (fun (a,b) -> powermod a b 10000000000I)
             |> Seq.sum 
   res % 10000000000I
   
   
printfn "%A" sum 

System.Console.ReadLine() |> ignore
