Title: Online courses

The Khan Academy (link) was a pioneer in online learning. However,
online learning really picked up speed in 2011 when a number of
Stanford professors started a number of freely available online
classes. I see it as a possibility to learn stuff in a structured way
as a side project next to work. As I participate in courses I will add
them to the following list with some remarks about my impression.

* Artificial Intelligence taught by Peter Norvig and Sebastian
  Thrun. Provided a nice overview and details about a variety of
  artificial intelligence algorithms.

* Logic (Coursera) taught by Mike Genesereth. The course was somewhat
  dry with a single excursion into a box-lab. Provided a refresher
  about logic.

* Software as a Service (Coursera - now EdX) taught by Armando Fox and
  David Paterson. This course was somewhat a disappointment. I had
  hoped for less Ruby and more Saas.

* Automata (Coursera) taught by Jeffrey Ullman. This course took my
  back to the days of university. Liked the course.

* Game Theory (Coursera) taught by Matthew O. Jackson and Yoav
  Shoham. Gave me a good introduction to the field of game theory. The
  course was one of the more challenging of the ones I have followed.

* Model Thinking (Coursera) taught by Scott E. Page. This is course
  that I have had the best experience with so far. The subjects were
  interesting and the level were perfect for me.

* Cryptography (Coursera) taught by Dan Boneh. Had a very academic
  approach and it was quite hard to follow.

* Design of Computer Programs (Udacity) taught by Peter Norvig. As
  with Artificial Intelligence Peter Norvig showed how good a
  communicator he is. Presented a range of techniques to solve various
  problems.

* Statistics (Coursera) taught by Andrew Conway. Gave an overview of
  basic statistical subjects and how to use the software package R to
  compute those. 

* Foundations of Computer Graphics (EdX) taught by Ravi
  Ramamoorthi. Provided an introduction to OpenGL programming and ray
  tracing. The OpenGL part was fairly straight forward. However, the
  ray tracing assignment was both challenging and fun.
